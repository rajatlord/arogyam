        summary:
          "Mental health isnâ€™t just 'not being sad.' Itâ€™s your emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how you think, feel, handle stress, and connect with others. Like physical health, it fluctuates over time. Some days are heavy, others light. It's okay to not be okay. Understanding and acknowledging it is the first step toward healing. Just like youâ€™d visit a doctor for a fever, your mind deserves attention too.",
